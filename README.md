## Hi, I'm Juan Carlos | Full Stack Dev

I'm a full-stack software engineer and I like to explore different areas of technology. I've always been curious and I'm always looking to learn something new, whether it's about development, software architecture or even non-programming subjects.  

I'm currently working on an **application to manage service scheduling** and a **financial control** app, where I'm applying what I've learned to create practical and efficient solutions.

### üöÄ **Tech Stack**  
- **Linguagens:** JavaScript, TypeScript, Python  
- **Front-end:** React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS  
- **Back-end:** Node.js, Express, NestJS  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis  
- **DevOps:** Docker, GitHub Actions

### üèÜ **Highlighted Projects**

- üìÖ [Vain](https://usevain.com.br/) - Application to manage service scheduling.

### Besides the code...

A dev can't live on programming alone! Outside of work, I'm an amateur racing driver and passionate about motorsport. I like challenges and testing my limits on the track, whether on asphalt or in a simulator.  

I also enjoy games, especially those that require strategy or skill, such as racing simulators, RPGs and competitive games. And when I'm not programming, playing or accelerating, I'm probably training or following sports.
